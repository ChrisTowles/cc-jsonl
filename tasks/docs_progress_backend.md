# Update Backend Implementation Progress

## Background

- Added guidance to `CLAUDE.md`
- Defined requirements in `docs/requirements.md`
- Defined use cases in `docs/usecases_*.tsv`
- Recording backend implementation progress in `docs/progress_backend.md`

## Task

- Compare design with implementation and update `docs/progress_backend.md`

## Notes

- Files may exist but implementation may not be complete
- Investigate thoroughly by layer and domain
- Limit the scope of this document to "recording backend implementation progress" only
