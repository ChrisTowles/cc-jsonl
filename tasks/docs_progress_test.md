# Update Test Implementation Progress

## Background

- Added guidance to `CLAUDE.md`
- Defined requirements in `docs/requirements.md`
- Defined use cases in `docs/usecases_*.tsv`
- Recording progress in `docs/progress_test.md`

## Task

- Compare design with implementation and update `docs/progress_test.md`

## Notes

- Verify that tests express specifications rather than matching implementation
- Limit the scope of this document to "recording test implementation progress"
- Do not execute tests
