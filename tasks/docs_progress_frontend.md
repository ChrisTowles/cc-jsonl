# Update Frontend Implementation Progress

## Background

- Added guidance to `CLAUDE.md`
- Defined requirements in `docs/requirements.md`
- Defined use cases in `docs/usecases_*.tsv`
- Recording frontend implementation progress in `docs/progress_frontend.md`

## Task

- Compare design with implementation and update `docs/progress_frontend.md`

## Notes

- Files may exist but implementation may not be complete
- Data may be mock/placeholder
- Functions may not be connected to backend
- Investigate thoroughly by page and component
- Limit the scope of this document to "recording frontend implementation progress" only
